Assignment #2: Lexical Analysis

Write a lexical analyzer program from scratch for recognizing KEYWORDS (if-then-else), IDENTIFIERS, NUMBERS etc. for your assigned language. You may use any language to implement the lexical analyzer.
Upload a zip file containing the lexical analyzer program, lexical analyzer output and your assigned language program. You can also upload a pdf in the zip file showing the input output in the terminal if you don't have specific input output files for your language.

Note:-

Do not use a pre-built lexical analyzer
Your assigned language program should be a program that has enough keywords, identifiers, numbers, etc that can help validate your lexical analyzer (It should not be a simple "Hello World" program)
The zip file naming should be Rollnumber_Assignment2.zip
