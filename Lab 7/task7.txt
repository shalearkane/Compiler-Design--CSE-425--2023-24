Assignment #7: Implementation of a 3-dimensional array

Use any grammar of your choice (with either fixed width or variable-width) to declare and access a 3-dimensional array, either in a row-major or column-major fashion. Show both declaration and access part taking input from the user. You can use YACC for implementation.

For example, you can test with
Declaration: int a[5][10][20];
access: y= a[2][3][4];
