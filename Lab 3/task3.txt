Assignment 3: Lexical Analysis using Lexical Analyzer

Implementation (programs) of recognizing KEYWORDS (if-then-else), IDENTIFIERS, OPERATORS and NUMBERS for your assigned language using LEX (or FLEX) or PLY (If you are using Python).
Upload a zip file containing the lexical analyzer program, lexical analyzer output and your assigned language program. You can
also upload a pdf in the zip file showing the input output in the terminal if you don't have specific input files for your
language.

Note:-

Your assigned language program should be a program that has enough keywords, identifiers, numbers, etc that can help validate your lexical analyzer (It should not be a simple "Hello World" program)
The zip file naming should be Rollnumber_Assignment3.zip
